kule kwenye web pointerEvent ilikuwa ni css na kufanya div isi-respond to anything we used
pointer-events: none; kwenye css ya div hiyo. so hapa in react native the "pointerEvent" is
not a style of css but a prop of the view component. so we can use it like this below:
<View pointerEvent="none"></View>

kumbuka sisi tulikuwa value mbili tu ambazo tulikuwa tunazitumia either "none" au "auto"

it's important to note that the Text component does not have a pointerEvents prop at all. SO, you will need to wrap the Text in a View and set the view's pointerEvents prop to be none.

pointerEvents work only on View not on Text or TouchableOpacity.
